This is my personal tutorial as I learn Angular.  Eventually, I anticipitate doing an app of some sort.  In the meantime, I will journal the mini-setps along the way.

Setup:
- Flask
- Angular
- Bootstrap

Deploy learningAngular as a Flask web application.  templates/index.html is the main index listing to navigate to the different samples.
